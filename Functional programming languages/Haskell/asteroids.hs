- Representation of the "world" game
- List of objects with the following invariant:
- * Is never empty; 
- * The first element is * always * the ship of the player.
World type = [Object]

- An object in space
- A pair of form and movement
Object type = (Shape, Movement) 

- Forms of different objects

- Position, linear speed, direction and angular velocity
